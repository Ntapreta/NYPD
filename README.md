NYPD-311

Response Aid Camp for NYC Citizens (final project)

This app helps to address the problem that many 311 users have: the manuvering and operation of 311 is sometimes inaccessible for citizens when they try report a complaint or a problem, because they need to click into multiple pages and fill in forms. This can discourage some people, many of which are low-income individuals, to report their problems to the city officials in a timely fashion. This application tries to offer helpful links to the citizens, while enabling them to report anything, anywhere, from their desktop to mobile devices. In doing so, the app gives average citizen the access to report quickly and more conveniently, as if they are reporting to the NYPD.
